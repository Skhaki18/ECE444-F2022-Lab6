# Section 1: Group Project Unit Test

Unit Test URL: https://github.com/ECE444-2022Fall/project-1-web-application-design-education-pathways-group-23-runtimeterror/blob/main/Education_Pathways/tests/test_course_api.py

In this file, I thoroughly test the course API including the pre-requisite checker.

# Section 2: Pros and Cons

Pros:
- Forces Modular coding style ensuring an independent feature style of development which is good for no single point of failure systems
- Code documentation is dramatically improved
- Allows code development tasks to be better subdivided among teams
- Individual features can be tested independently and decreasing the necessary development time and increasing overall test coverage
- Enables small mistakes to be caught quickly and efficiently

Cons:
- Increases time to completion of every feature
- Testing needs to be adapted if subsequent features are built into the existing codebase
- Large suite of tests to be managed and requires additional work to keep them up to date
- Must be uniform across the entire team and difficult to apply to legacy codebases
- Very difficult on team morale and motivation
